course_description: 'This set of 10 lectures (about 11+ hours in duration) was excerpted
  from a three-day course developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to provide an understanding
  of radar systems concepts and technologies to military officers and DoD civilians
  involved in radar systems development, acquisition, and related fields. That three-day
  program consists of a mixture of lectures, demonstrations, laboratory sessions,
  and tours.
