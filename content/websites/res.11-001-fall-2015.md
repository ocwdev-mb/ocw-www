course_description: 'Created in 2012 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
  the Comprehensive Initiative on Technology Evaluation ([CITE](http://cite.mit.edu/))
  is the first-ever program dedicated to developing methods for product evaluation
  in global development. CITE produces technology evaluations that provide evidence
  for data-driven decision-making by development workers, donors, manufacturers, suppliers,
  and consumers themselves. In addition, CITE evaluations lead to significant developing
  insights, helping us better understand development challenges.
