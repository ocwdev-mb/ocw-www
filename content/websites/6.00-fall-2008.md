course_description: "This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming\
  \ experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation\
  \ can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their\
  \ major, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs\
  \ that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Python\u2122\
  \ programming language.\n"
