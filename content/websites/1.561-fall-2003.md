course_description: 'This course presents a rational basis for the preliminary design
  of motion-sensitive structures. Topics covered include: analytical and numerical
  techniques for establishing the optimal stiffness distribution, the role of damping
  in controlling motion, tuned mass dampers, base isolation systems, and active structural
  control. Examples illustrating the application of the motion-based design paradigm
  to building structures subjected to seismic excitation are discussed.
