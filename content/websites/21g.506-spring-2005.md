course_description: 'This course covers Lessons 27 through 30 of _Japanese: The Spoken
  Language_ by Eleanor H. Jordan with Mari Noda. The goal of the course is to continue
  expanding grammar and vocabulary by further developing four skills: speaking, listening,
  reading, and writing. The goal is to acquire the ability to use Japanese appropriately
  with increasing spontaneity emphasized, and to be prepared to become an independent
  learner to the point where you are capable of handling authentic Japanese by yourself,
  without fear or hesitation.
