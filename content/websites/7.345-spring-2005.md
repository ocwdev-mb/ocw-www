course_description: "In this course, evolutionary pathways that have led to the development\
  \ of innate and adaptive immunity are analyzed, the conserved and unique features\
  \ of the immune response from bacteria to higher vertebrates is traced, and factors,\
  \ such as adaptive changes in pathogens that have shaped the evolution of immune\
  \ system are identified.\n\nThis course is one of many\_[Advanced Undergraduate\
  \ Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/course_listings/advanced_undergraduate_seminars)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting.\n"
