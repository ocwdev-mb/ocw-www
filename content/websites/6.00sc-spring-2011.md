course_description: 'This subject is aimed at students with **little or no programming
  experience**. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation
  can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their
  major, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that
  allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Python programming
  language.


  Course Format


  This course has been designed for independent study. It provides everything you
  will need to understand the concepts covered in the course. The materials include:


  - A complete set of **Lecture Videos** by Prof. Guttag.

  - Resources for each lecture video, such as **Handouts, Slides,** and **Code Files.**

  - **Recitation Videos** by course TA''s to review content and problem solving techniques.

  - **Homework** problems with sample student solutions.

  - **Further Study** collections of links to supplemental online content.
