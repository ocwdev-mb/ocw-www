course_description: 'This course explores the foundations of policy making in developing
  countries. The goal is to spell out various policy options and to quantify the trade-offs
  between them. We will study the different facets of human development: education,
  health, gender, the family, land relations, risk, informal and formal norms and
  institutions. This is an empirical class. For each topic, we will study several
  concrete examples chosen from around the world. While studying each of these topics,
  we will ask: What determines the decisions of poor households in developing countries?
  What constraints are they subject to? Is there a scope for policy (by government,
  international organizations, or non-governmental organizations (NGOs))? What policies
  have been tried out? Have they been successful?
