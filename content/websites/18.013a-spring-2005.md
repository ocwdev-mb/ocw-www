course_description: 'This is an undergraduate course on differential calculus in one
  and several dimensions. It is intended as a one and a half term course in calculus
  for students who have studied calculus in high school. The format allows it to be
  entirely self contained, so that it is possible to follow it without any background
  in calculus.
