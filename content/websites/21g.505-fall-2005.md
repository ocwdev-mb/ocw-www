  Class hours will be devoted to developing speaking skills in a variety of circumstances;
  making requests, invitations, apologies, suggestions, dealing with problems, expressing
  your opinions, etc. Grammatical and social appropriateness on your utterances will
  be stressed. Keep in mind that daily tape-work is essential.
