course_description: 'This course applies microeconomic theory to analysis of public
  policy. It builds from the microeconomic model of consumer behavior and extends
  to operation of single and multiple markets and analysis of why markets sometimes
  fail. We will study empirical examples to evaluate theory, focusing on the casual
  effects of policy interventions on economic outcomes. Topics include minimum wages
  and employment, food stamps and consumer welfare, economics of risk and safety regulation,
  the value of education, and gains from international trade.
