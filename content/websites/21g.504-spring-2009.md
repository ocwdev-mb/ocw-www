course_description: 'This course covers _Japanese: The Spoken Language_ lessons 17
  through 22. It will further develop the four basic skills, speaking, listening,
  reading and writing, that students have acquired through Japanese I, II and III
  courses, with emphasis on oral communication skills in various practical situations.
  Students will learn approximately 100 Kanji characters in this course. Sessions
  in English cover grammar explanation, socio-cultural information and other important
  issues for using the language, while Japanese lessons focus on the actual use of
  the language, integrating students'' prior knowledge with newly learned patterns,
  and communicating within the frame given in the class.
